Katie here!
I have all the basic components working from what we had submitted at the end of last semester. In this branch, I haven't included the downloading images part that Dillion E has done. That is something that needs to be added. 

The original scripts and assets should all be within this branch.
Please let me know if you have any questions. 

List of bugs in transition to template:
-The clickable area of the playback buttons is more precise than normal. Don't know if that is because of the template.
-The start and end index don't change the number of points played.
-The play and pause buttons don't fade when there is no more audio to play.
-The general spacing of some of the elements is not great.
-The Settings and Information modals don't work as they should.
